# Digital-Storage-Oscilloscope

This repository is for my digital storage oscilloscope project.

This project is a year long project with two other students to build a digital storage oscilloscope
using the Cyclone V FPGA SOC. This is a yearlong project and is ongoing. The project will be complete during 
spring term 2020.
