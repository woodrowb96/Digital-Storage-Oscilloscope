This folder has code for an interface testing module.

This module was used to help me debug and test my blocks in the system.

This module generates an adc_clk, and lets me change the frequency of the clk. 
The adc_clk has an enable that lets me test my data_aq state machine.

This module also displayes the stream of samples from the adc onto a seven seg display.


interface_test.sv is the top level module
