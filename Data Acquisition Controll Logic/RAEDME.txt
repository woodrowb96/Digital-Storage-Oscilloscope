This folder contains the SystemVerilog code for the data acquisiton control logic block. 

Inside this block there is a state machine that controlls the acquisition process. There is also a counter that is used by the 
state machine to count clock cycles. Finally there is a memory controller block, that is cotrolled by the state machine and that
stores samples from the adc into memory.
